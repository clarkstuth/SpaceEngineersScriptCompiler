# SpaceEngineersScriptCompiler

Space Engineers Script Compiler (SESC) is a project designed around making writing re-usable code for Space Engineers easier.

With SESC, you will be able to write your Space Engineers code in Visual Studio and easily "compile" this code into a Space Engineers friendly format.

This project is in ALPHA stages and is not suited for any form of production use.

This project is not intended to change any in game or base functionality within Space Engineers other than make it easier to write code re-usables.
